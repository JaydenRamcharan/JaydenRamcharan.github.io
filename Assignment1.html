    <h1><strong>Re: Eileen Dover university application</strong></h1>

    <p>Dear, Eileen</p>

    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science facility to study as part </p>
    <p>of you PhD next year. I will awnser your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

    <h2><strong>Starting dates</strong></h2>
    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you</p>
    <p>could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which date would you prefer.</p>

    <p> You can find more information about <a href="#">important university dates</a> on our website</p>
    <h3>Subjects of study</h3>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall</p>
    <p>somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just</p>
    <p>the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued</p>
    <p>by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). </li>

        <li>Measuring the effect on preformance of funk bassplayers at tempatures exceeding 30&deg;C (86&deg;F) when the
        audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 &times; 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 &times; 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>

        <li><span class="dotted-underline">HTML</span> and <span class="dotted-underline">CSS</span> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, inclluding how long you'd expect the</p>
    <p>research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

    <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>

    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To awnser your question, </p>
    <p>my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions</p>

    <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
    <dd>A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance datig back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around</dd>
    <dd>in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd>
    <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
    <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which</dd>
    <dd>involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly</dd>
    <dd>tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired</dd>
    <dd>modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
    <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
    <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have</dd>
    <dd>discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants</dd>
    <dd>of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this</dd>
    <dd>because they were really cold</dd>

    <p>for more of my research, <a href="#">see my exotic dance research page </a></p>

    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
