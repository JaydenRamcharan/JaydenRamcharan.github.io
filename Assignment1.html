  <h1><strong>Re: Eileen Dover university application</strong></h1>

<p>Dear, Eileen</p>

<p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science facility to study as part </p>
<p>of you PhD next year. I will awnser your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

<h2><strong>Starting dates</strong></h2>
<p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you</p>
<p>could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>

<ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which date would you prefer</p>

    <p> You can find more information about important university dates on our website</p>
    <h3>Subjects of study</h3>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall</p>
    <p>somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just</p>
    <p>the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued</p>
    <p>by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>

    <ol>
<li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). </li>
<li>Measuring the effect on preformance of funk bassplayers at tempatures exceeding 30&deg;C (86&deg;F) when the 
  audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup>increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)
</li>

    </ol>
